     The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
    <br><br>
     In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
    <br><br>
     BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
    <br><br>
    The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
    <br><br>
    
    
    YOUR 3 CHALLENGES
    Change the game to follow these rules:
    1. A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, 
    it's the next player's turn. (Hint: Always save the previous dice roll in a separate
         variable)
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that 
    they can change the predefined score of 0. (Hint: you can read that value with the 
        .value property in JavaScript. This is a good oportunity to use google to figure 
        this out :)
        <br>
        <br>
    
    3. Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses
     his current score when one of them is a 1. (Hint: you will need CSS to position the
         second dice, so take a look at the CSS code for the first one.)
