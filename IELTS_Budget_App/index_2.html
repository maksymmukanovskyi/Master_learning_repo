    <p><span class="first-letter">S</span>econd Table  store your hours in database, keep in mind to calculate days you need to type both your current IELTS scores and desired hours per day to learn, for each module. Otherwise message will be triggered</p>
    <br>
    <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>hird table do calculation of days to learn</p>
    <p>Simplified version of formula:</p>
    <br>
    <h3>DAYS = (((IELTS SCORE CREDIT - YOUR CREDIT)/4)/HRS PER DAY) ITERATED OVER EACH IELTS SCORE</h3>
    <br>
    <p>If you have more than minimum IELTS credit for each IELTS score, you will have "_____" days it means you do not need to learn particular module for given score</p>
    <P>Your current hourly credit score will be shown on the left side of the mentioned table</P>
    <br>
    <p><span class="first-letter">F</span>orth table will calculate cost for each of four scores with custom rate field to enter.</p>
    <p>Table ONLY will work if you type rate per hour, additionally if you have average of your credit score higher then any of the provided scores (6, 6.5, 7, 7.5) than you will receive "0.00 hrn" as the cost for tutorials, it means you don't need tutorials for that score. </p>
    <p>For the tutorial calculation i took in consideration just two modules,- "speaking" and "writing", you don't need to spend money for "listening" and "reading"</p>
    <p>So simplified version of formula for the cost:</p>
    <br>
    <h3>COST = COST/HR * ((IELTS SCORE CREDIT - (WRITING CREDIT + SPEAKING CREDIT)/2)/4)
        ITERATED OVER EACH IELTS SCORE IF YOUR AVERAGE CREDIT IS LOWER THAN IELTS CREDIT FOR EACH MODULE.
    </h3>
    <p>Hope  it will be usefull for you</p>
